Bomberman type game

CONTROLLS:

  Player 1: 
    movement: WASD 
    drop bomb: Space 
    
  Player 2: 
    movement: Arrow keys
    drop bomb: Enter

Bomb is dropped on bombkey UP not down because when key is held down the player will be stationairy and can change throw direction with movement keys
If the player doesnt have a free space infront of him the player will drop the bomb at his feet. not using the "Bounce".
If the player does have a free space infront of him the player will "throw" the bomb in direction shown. it will bouce for 3 seconds before exploding.
